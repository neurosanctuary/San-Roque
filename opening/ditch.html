            <p>She just stood there as I layed on the ground. She didn’t try to come closer, nor get far away.</p>
            <p>She just watched me.</p>
            <p>And her gaze was unintelligible.</p>
          <p>I tried to speak but the words wouldn’t come out. I held a paw out to her.</p>
          <p>Old friend, won’t you reach for my paw?</p>
          <p>
            But her face turned scared, and I began to scramble off the ground to grab on to her.
            She ran away and I watched as she headed towards a nearby town.

          <p>Did I really miss seeing an entire <a href="town.html">town</a> before I fell?</p>
