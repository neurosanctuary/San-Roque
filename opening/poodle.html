          <p>Shocking to hear a voice, as the town had felt empty.</p>
          <p>Behind me stood a curly fur individual, her tone welcoming, and her face shining with a big smile.</p>
          <p>“No, I’m just looking for someone. Have you seen a dog like this?”</p>
          <p>“Nope, and neither have you! Searching for eight months! Are you tired yet?”</p>
          <p>“No, I’m not tired. Where’d you even get that idea from?”</p>
          <p>“It’s in your eyes, but you wouldn’t know since you’ve never looked in the mirror in so long.”</p>
          <p>Poodles. So nosey. My mother was ¼ poodle. Though I guess that would make me ⅛ poodle, if I’m doing the math correctly. But I don’t think I’m nosey. I’m just curious.</p>
          <p>She told me no, yet this poodle keeps her eyes on me, interested in my next move. Does she not have anything better to do? Am I her only focus? Makes sense if I were to live in a <a href="places.html">dead town</a> like this one.</p>
          <p>“You should ask the others about her. But come back around if you need an extra paw.”</p>
          <p>No thank you lady. I can handle it myself.</p>
          <p>But where are the others in this town?</p>
