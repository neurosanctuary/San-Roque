            <p>I could care less about how much I exhaust myself, I bear with it. I bear with the dry heat. I bear with the dirt in my eyes. I bear with the sleepless nights. I do it all for her. 
                Is that so wrong?
                I don’t think it is.
                
                “Is there a better option then?”
                “Take time out of your day to think about yourself. Not just what you want for Biscuit or what she’d want for you.”
                “It’s not as easy as it sounds. I see no wrong in keeping her my priority.”
                “But if you do find her, you’ll have exhausted yourself to the point of collapse.”
                “And then?”
                “And then there won’t be <a href="myself.html">enough of you</a> left for her.”
