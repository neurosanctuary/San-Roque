            <p>	If part of me is gone, then who am I?
                What am I doing?
                I have been trying so hard yet will I become unrecognizable for her?
            
                It’s true my fur has gotten long and matted.
                My ribs show at times.
                I have new wounds from my journey that I haven’t been considerate to.
                
                I’ve been damaging myself, yet I failed to see what was so wrong with it.
                Not until the <a href="tender.html">tender touch</a> of another that I had desperately needed, helped <a href="better.html">guide me</a>.
                </p>
