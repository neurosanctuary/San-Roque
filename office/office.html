              Dingy, shabby, yet attempting to be welcoming. Almost like a joke, a sign was placed by it that read, “Yes, we are always open!” Nailed in flyers decorated a newer looking board by the door. I can’t imagine this town had too many events going on. Were flyers even necessary? This town can do word of mouth events. Or was the board an attempt at a community center? What community even? I shouldn’t judge a town I don’t live in, but this is the loneliest town I’ve ever been in.

          A sheepish voice says right next to me. I hadn’t even noticed I was snuck on as the door left no creaks nor did the Labrador before me make a sound with her steps.
