            <div class="roy2"> <p>San Roque originally started as a short comic I would doodle shortly after my friend, Isabel, passed in 2022. A wolf and a coyote, hanging out and getting into stupid antics. Nothing super interesting but something I wanted to develop, and eventually I changed them to just normal dogs and made it a story that leaned more into my grief. I didn’t want to write a narrative that just says, grief goes away or that grief is awful! It’s just about living with grief and all the various ways I felt with it. Grief can linger on you for days, months, and years. I would have times where I would work on this project, and grief would seize my body from doing proper work. I couldn’t move and I couldn’t think right. And my mind would just fog. But I wanted to create some positivity around it. Maybe for myself. Maybe for the others around me. That’s what I hoped to accomplish in my writing of this.
            </p>   <p>This story was written out of love and pain. And that is how my life has been. There are ups and downs. And there are times where I remember the happiest days, then there are times where I feel devastation run down my spine. But I want to continue on! I want to do things that remind me of those happy moments and especially of my friend. She was my biggest supporter as well as my biggest inspiration, and I want to make things that she would absolutely of loved to have seen. It can make my day just a bit brighter to think of how she would react to my work.
            </p> <p> I hope you enjoy San Roque!
