    <p>I wrote <i>San Roque</i> with the intention of it being this beautiful art piece that I spent so much time on and love and effort. But if you do this and try to be a full time student, you instead just think about killing yourself everyday because you miss your dead best friend more than you have the motivation to draw for your dead best friend. I'm not happy. I wanted to commit suicide multiple times during the semester I worked on this. I wanted to scream, I wanted to shout. But I'm still here and I'll be here because I want to be here for her.
        Isabel passed away in May of 2022, I have not been living out the same life ever since then.
        I hate all the art I drew for this, it's not my best but it is my attempt to be as free as my mind can be.
        <i>San Roque</i> isn't about finding peace, but about working towards it.
        I hope one day I can find that peace, but now is just not the time.
        Isabel was the most beautiful person I have ever known, she was like the sunshine as a person. I live to keep that sunshine still shining.
