          <div class="store2"><p>The general store was painted the brightest out of every building in this town. Of course, nature has still worn it down. But its blues stood out amongst the dull browns and reds.</p></div>
          <div class="store3"><p>Upon entering, a little chime rung, a sweet smell, and a decent stock held within shelves, bags, and barrels. A Shepherd stood by the counter, wagging their tail as they rearranged a window flowerbed. They were vibrant flowers, not native to central California at all that was for sure. It was a surprise the dog managed to maintain them this well and didn’t let them get scorched from the heat. The chime of the door didn’t alert them to my presence, they were fixed in their own world. So I walked closer to the counter, another bell to ring.</p></div>
