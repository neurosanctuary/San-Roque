                  I very much do think about if what I am doing is worthwhile.
                  <br></br>
Am I happy with my search?
<br></br>
No.
<br></br>
But it is that small belief that I will no longer feel lonely which will keep me going.
<br></br>
Some little grain of hope.
<br></br>
I replay every moment with her in my head.
<br></br>
I think about what we will do in the future.
<br></br>
I think about my own future and then hers.
<br></br>
How we may go separate paths but still meet up.
<br></br>
How we will smile at each otherâ€™s lives.
How our friendship will last for years to come.
<br></br>
If I am <a href="andbetween.html">unhappy</a> now, does that matter too much?<br></br>

For if it all works out, then I will smile more.
